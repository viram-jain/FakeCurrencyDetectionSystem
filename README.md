## :innocent: Motivation
Recognition of fake Indian currency is very important in major domains like banking. This system is used to detect whether the currency is fake or original through the automated system which is through convolution neural networks, in deep learning. The problem is that common people these days are facing issues in regard to circulating fake currencies and are not able to recognize which notes are real and which are counterfeit. The main objective of this project is to make it convenient for any common man to know whether or not a note is real by using our desktop or android application.

## :warning: TechStack/Framework used

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Dart](https://dart.dev/)

## :bulb: Working

The program will function in the following way:
1. The model is trained on multiple images of fake and real Indian currency.
2. An image of the note is passed as input to the desktop application which returns the result with an accuracy of 70-80%.
3. Same process is followed for the Android application as well.
4. An image of the note is passed as input to the Android application which returns the result with an accuracy of 70-75%.
